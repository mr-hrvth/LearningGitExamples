# The Lessons of a Bird: A Short Story - BY ALLEN KLEIN

Here is a story about a bird who found his lessons in the most unlikely of places:

    Once upon a time, there was a nonconforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter. 
    However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly started southward. 
    In a short time, ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen. 
    A cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow. The sparrow thought it was the end. 
    But then the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. Warm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing. 
    Just then a large cat came by and hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds. 
    The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping sparrow and promptly ate him.

Now, it may seem that there are no lessons here, but there are. In fact, there are three:

1. Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily enemy.
2. Everyone who gets you out of shit is not necessarily your friend.
3.
